# **Rule Engine using Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)**

## **Overview**

This project is a simple **Rule Engine** that uses Python's **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)** to dynamically evaluate rules based on user data. The application consists of a **Flask-based web interface** where users can input rules and data to determine eligibility or other conditions using custom logic.

## **Features**
- Parse and evaluate logical rules dynamically using AST.
- Supports basic logical operators (`and`, `or`, `>`, `<`, `==`).
- Custom function support (e.g., `is_senior(age)` to check if the age is greater than 60).
- Simple user interface to input rules and data in JSON format.
- Provides feedback on evaluation results (`True` or `False`).
- Syntax validation and attribute validation for rule inputs.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Python** (AST for rule parsing and evaluation)
- **Flask** (Web framework for serving the UI and API endpoints)
- **HTML + JavaScript** (Frontend interface)

## **Installation and Setup**

### **Prerequisites**
Make sure you have **Python 3.7+** installed on your machine.
